# Exploring NumPy for Numerical Data Analysis (100 Days of Python)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as an introduction to the NumPy library, which is essential for numerical data analysis in Python. The notebook walks through the key features of NumPy, including creating and manipulating arrays, performing linear algebra operations, and even processing images using NumPy and related libraries.

## Contents

### Notebook Sections
1. **Introduction to NumPy Arrays**: Learn the basics of NumPy's ndarray, including creating one-dimensional arrays (vectors), two-dimensional arrays (matrices), and multi-dimensional arrays (tensors).
2. **Array Indexing and Slicing**: Practice using indexing techniques to extract specific elements, rows, or columns.
3. **NumPy Mini-Challenges**: A set of hands-on exercises to test your understanding of the ndarray and to get comfortable with creating arrays, slicing, reshaping, and other common operations.
4. **Image Processing with NumPy**: Use ndarrays to manipulate image data. Includes grayscale conversion, rotation, and solarization challenges.
5. **Linear Algebra with Vectors**: Explore linear algebra operations like matrix multiplication, broadcasting, and scalar operations.

### Requirements
- **NumPy**: For working with numerical data.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and images.
- **SciPy**: For accessing sample images.
- **PIL** (Pillow): For reading image files.

You can install the required libraries with:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```sh
jupyter notebook numpy_intro.ipynb
```

3.Follow along with the exercises to gain a better understanding of numerical operations and image manipulation using NumPy.
